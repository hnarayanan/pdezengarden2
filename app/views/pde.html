<p>The Laplace equation is so important that functions that satisfy it have a special name: they are said to be <em>harmonic</em>. The equation is: $$\Delta u = 0,$$ where $\Delta = \partial^{2}/\partial x_{1}^{2} + \ldots + \partial^{2}/\partial x_{d}^{2}$ is the operator known, inevitably, as the <em>Laplacian</em>.
